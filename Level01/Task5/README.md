# Predicting-House-Pricing 

The goal of this project is to predict house prices in Kings County, USA using a dataset of 21,613 records and 20 features. 

 My team and I first understood the data set. After this, we did preprocessing and cleaning of the data including
(checking and dealing with missing values / duplicate values / outliers) . 

Then, we did exploratory data analysis to understand the distributions and relationships between the target and features. 

Following that, we used a different method such as Backword elimination and Lasso to select features.

Next, we built machine learning models using RandomForest and GradientBoosting and tried to enhance them using Hypermeter tuning. 

Finally ,In order to be able to use the model by non-technical people, we had to create a web page (User Interface). .
